## Phase 1 — Materials Liquidity Engine

> **Theme:** Establish the core marketplace for construction materials — connecting verified vendors with buyers.

### 🎯 Goals
- Create a functional B2B materials marketplace from the ground up
- Enable vendor onboarding, product discovery, and quote-to-order workflows
- Implement basic payment tracking and dispute handling
- Lay the identity and data foundations for all future phases

### 🧩 New Backend Modules
| Module | App | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| User Accounts | `accounts` | Authentication, role assignment, user profiles |
| Vendor Profiles | `accounts` | Verified vendor identities with performance metrics |
| Product Catalogue | `catalog` | Material listings with inventory, pricing, and availability |
| Orders | `orders` | Full order lifecycle from placement to delivery |
| Payments | `payments` | Payment transaction records (gateway-ready structure) |
| Disputes | `disputes` | Order conflict management and resolution tracking |
| Reviews | `reviews` | Buyer ratings and vendor reputation engine |
| Taxonomy | `taxonomy` | Category classification for products and services |

### 🔑 Key Data Models

```
User ──▶ VendorProfile ──▶ Product ──▶ Order ──▶ Payment
                                          │
                                          └──▶ Dispute
```

| Model | Key Fields |
|---|---|
| `User` | `email`, `role` (ADMIN, VENDOR, BUYER, CONTRACTOR…), `created_at` |
| `VendorProfile` | `company_name`, `verified_status`, `fulfillment_rate`, `average_rating` |

GET|POST   /api/accounts/register/
POST       /api/token/
```

### ➡️ Sets the stage for
Phase 2 — who executes the *work* on the materials? → Contractors.

---

## Phase 2 — Contracts & Execution Layer

> **Theme:** Extend the platform from material procurement into construction services — introducing contractor onboarding, competitive bidding, and milestone-based job execution.

### 🎯 Goals
- Enable project owners to post construction tenders
- Allow contractors to discover, bid on, and win contracts
- Implement milestone-based execution and payment trigger workflow
- Build role-segmented dashboards for owners and contractors

### 🧩 New Backend Modules
| Module | App | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Contractors | `contractors` | Company profiles, capability taxonomy, verification queue |
| Contracts | `contracts` | Tender posting, status workflow, contract lifecycle |
| Bids | `bids` | Bid submission, shortlisting, and award engine |
| Milestones | `milestones` | Execution checkpoints with approval-triggered payment |

### 🔑 Key Data Models

```
Contract (Tender) ◀──── Owner posts
     │
     └──▶ Bids (Contractor submits) ──▶ Award ──▶ Contract IN_PROGRESS
                                                        │
                                                        └──▶ Milestones ──▶ Approve ──▶ Pay
```

| Model | Key Fields |
|---|---|
| `Contractor` | `company_name`, `service_categories`, `is_verified`, `rating_avg` |
| `Contract` | `title`, `budget_min/max`, `status` (POSTED → AWARDED → COMPLETED) |
| `Bid` | `proposed_cost`, `proposed_timeline_days`, `status` (SUBMITTED → AWARDED) |
| `Milestone` | `title`, `amount`, `due_date`, `status` (PENDING → APPROVED → PAID) |

### 🌐 Frontend Views
- `ContractorRegistration.vue` — Contractor onboarding form
- `ViewTenders.vue` — Active tender discovery for contractors
- `ContractList.vue` — Full contract marketplace
- `ContractDetail.vue` — Bid submission, award, and milestone tracking
- `PostContract.vue` — Owner tender creation
- `ContractorDashboard.vue` — Active jobs and milestone tracking

### 🔗 API Endpoints (v2)
```
POST       /api/contractors/register/
GET|POST   /api/contracts/
POST       /api/contracts/{id}/bids/
POST       /api/bids/{id}/award/
POST       /api/contracts/{id}/milestones/
POST       /api/milestones/{id}/approve/
```

### ➡️ Sets the stage for
Phase 3 — milestones need *real* escrow-backed fund releases, not placeholders.

---

## Phase 3 — Financial Infrastructure Layer

> **Theme:** Replace payment placeholders with real escrow mechanics — creating a trustworthy financial backbone with dispute arbitration and embedded credit.

### 🎯 Goals
- Implement full escrow fund holding and release mechanics
- Automate fund release on milestone approval (atomic transactions)
- Build dispute resolution with escrow freeze capability
- Introduce embedded finance (credit/loan products)
- Lay the foundation for contractor reliability scoring

### 🧩 New Backend Modules
| Module | App | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Escrow | `escrow` | Fund holding, ledger, milestone-triggered releases |
| Finance | `finance` | Loan products and credit applications |
| Scoring | `scoring` | Contractor reliability score (0–100) |

### 🔑 Key Data Models

```
Contract ──▶ EscrowAccount ──▶ EscrowTransaction (DEPOSIT / RELEASE / REFUND)
                  │
                  └──▶ EscrowRelease (triggered by Milestone Approval)
                  │
                  └──▶ EscrowHold (triggered by Dispute — freezes funds)
                              │
                              └── Admin resolves ──▶ Release or Refund
```

| Model | Key Fields |
|---|---|
| `EscrowAccount` | `contract`, `total_amount_held`, `currency`, `status` (ACTIVE/RELEASED) |
| `EscrowTransaction` | `type` (DEPOSIT/RELEASE/REFUND), `amount`, `milestone`, `payment_reference` |
| `EscrowRelease` | `milestone`, `approved_by`, `released_amount`, `release_status` |
| `EscrowHold` | `escrow_account`, `dispute`, `reason`, `status` |
| `FinanceProduct` | Credit product definitions |
| `FinanceApplication` | `status` (SUBMITTED → APPROVED → DISBURSED) |
| `ReliabilityScore` | `contractor`, `score` (0–100), `risk_tier` |

### 🔑 Key Workflows
1. **Escrow Funding** → Owner deposits funds against a contract
2. **Milestone Automation** → Approving a milestone atomically releases funds (if escrow active and not frozen)
3. **Dispute Freeze** → Filing a dispute creates an `EscrowHold`, blocking all releases
4. **Arbitration** → Admin resolves dispute, lifting the hold and executing Refund or Release

### 🔗 API Endpoints (v3)
```
POST       /api/escrow/deposit/
POST       /api/escrow-releases/trigger/
POST       /api/disputes/
POST       /api/disputes/{id}/evidence/
POST       /api/disputes/{id}/resolve/
GET        /api/finance/products/
POST       /api/finance/applications/
GET        /api/scoring/
```

### ➡️ Sets the stage for
Phase 4 — escrow-backed projects need *project-level* structure, not just contract-level.

---

## Phase 4 — Projects, Property & Capital Pipeline

> **Theme:** Introduce the concept of a **Project** as the master entity — connecting materials procurement, contracts, financing, and real estate into a unified capital pipeline.

### 🎯 Goals
- Create a top-level `Project` entity that aggregates all platform activities
- Enable investors to discover and pledge capital to construction projects
- Connect real estate/property listings to upstream project demand
- Provide project owners with a unified execution dashboard

### 🧩 New Backend Modules
